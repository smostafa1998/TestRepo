Working directiory - local repository
Improve code without changing baseline code
1. Add to stage
2. From stage commit, ready to be pushed
Not adding it yet (red)
Git add srs/sample.txt
Git commit -m (add a comment) “Added sample.txt file”
Red (file on local but not remote) -> white
3. Push remote (cloud repository) git push pirigin master
See error failed to push master is not the name
Git push organ main
Numerical numbers the unique ID for the commit
Main branch from local-> main branch from remote
